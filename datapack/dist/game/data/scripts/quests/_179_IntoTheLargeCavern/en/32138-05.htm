<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
You can find N in a cave, but at first you should pass through Sad Nornila. A way through this garden at all from the lungs. On a way you will be trapped by set of dangers. Therefore I advise to you to get partners which can cover your backs in the fullness of time.<br>
In a garden of Nornila you will need to get a key which can open a door. In a cave there are three doors which can be opened by means of Time Statues: the Statue of Proshchlogo, Statuja Nastrojashchego and the Future Statue. To each door the password is necessary, but don't worry, the same passwords which you used before.<br>
You in something for doubted?<br>
