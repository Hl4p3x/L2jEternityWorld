To congratulate you on your achievements, the Adventure Guild is pleased to open its warehouse to both apprentice adventurers who have reached level 6 as well as to travelers who have completed their first class transfer. At level 6, you can use the <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice Adventurer's Weapon Exchange Coupon</font> to borrow a <font color="LEVEL">No-Grade Shadow Weapon</font>. At level 20, you can use the <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Magic Accessory Exchange Coupon</font> to borrow <font color="LEVEL">Shadow Armor</font>. No-Grade Shadow Weapons can be exchanged up to level 19, and Shadow Armor can be exchanged up to level 39. So how can I help you?<br>
(Chaotic characters may not use weapons or armor borrowed from the Adventure Guild.)<br>
