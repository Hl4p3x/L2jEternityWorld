Do you remember all the materials needed for the bouquet?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">20 mandragora flower petals</font> and <font color="LEVEL">10 bunches of crimson moss</font>. You may acquire the petals from the *mandragoras* that grow on the west parts of the execution grounds, and the moss is found near the *crimson ants of the Cruma marshlands*. Good luck, then. I hope to make the bouquet soon and see my mother smile.
