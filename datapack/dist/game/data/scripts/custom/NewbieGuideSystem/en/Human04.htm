I will now assign you your final mission.<br>
Go help <font color="LEVEL">Elias</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">village square</font>. To find him, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. Come see me again after you have completed the task he gives you.<br>
Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you?<br>
