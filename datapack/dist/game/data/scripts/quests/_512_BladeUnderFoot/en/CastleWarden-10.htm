<html><body>Detention Camp Warden:<br>
The dungeon monster camp in this castle was only recently discovered.<br>
Apparently, some long-dead emperor created this place years and years ago in order to breed the monsters for the sake of magical experimentation.<br>
Another rumor says that this place was used as a prison for criminals and evil creatures.<br>Whatever the real reason for its existence, the entrance had been hidden for a very long time. <br>
Since you've volunteered your services, your task will be to eliminate <font color="LEVEL">Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer</font>, 
creatures that are members of the last of <font color="LEVEL">three small groups</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">castle dungeon</font>
and obtain the <font color="LEVEL">sign of the camp prisoner's leader</font>.<br>
