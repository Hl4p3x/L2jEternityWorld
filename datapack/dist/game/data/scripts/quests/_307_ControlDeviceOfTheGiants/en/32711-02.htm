The problem will be not from simple! Three ancient Giants live in the given place. It`s the Giant *Marpanak *, *Gorgolos* and *Last Titan Utenus*.<br>
Each of them stores secret of the Giant *Hekaton Prime*. Having killed three giants you can receive ancient papyruses. As soon as will collect all three papyruses come back to me and I can show to you where lives Hekaton Prime.
