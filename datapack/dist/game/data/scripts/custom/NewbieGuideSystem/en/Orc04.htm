I will now assign you your final mission.<br>
Go help <font color="LEVEL">Seer Tanapi</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Hall of the King</font>. To find her, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. Come see me again after you have completed the task she gives you.<br>
Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you?<br>
