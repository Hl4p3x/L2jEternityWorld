You are well on your way to becoming a mighty adventurer!<br>
Now go help <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Roien</font> at <font color="LEVEL">Cedric's Training Hall</font>. To find him, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. When you have completed the task he gives you, come see me for your final mission.<br>
