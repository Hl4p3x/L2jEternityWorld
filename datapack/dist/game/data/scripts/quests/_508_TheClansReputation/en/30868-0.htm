Thank you! There are several Raid Bosses near the village. Which one can you defeat?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Remember, you don't have to kill the Raid Boss by yourself.</font> There is no rule that says the clan leader has to use his sword. <font color="LEVEL">If your clan members defeat the Raid Boss, simply bring back proof of your victory.</font><br>
