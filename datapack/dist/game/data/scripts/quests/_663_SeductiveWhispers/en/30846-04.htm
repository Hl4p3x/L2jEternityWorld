All right! If that's what you want, I'll let you join in.<br>
You can't be ready for the game already, can you? You're not thinking of joining in without bringing anything to the table, are you? You have to go get one item if you want to enjoy a game with us. It's not so hard to find, but we need to have <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> to make weapons. I'll give you the details another time, but for now, go to <font color="LEVEL">Aden Cemetery, the Ancient Battleground</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Fields of Massacre</font> and get some <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from the undead and the demons.<br>
Did I explain enough?<br>
