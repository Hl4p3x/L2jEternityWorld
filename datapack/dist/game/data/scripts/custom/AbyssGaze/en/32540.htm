<html><body>Gatekeeper of the Abyss:<br>
You sense an icy cold gaze fixed on you from a gigantic structure that seems somehow not quite alive nor dead. You must pass its judgment to enter the <font color="LEVEL">heart of the Seed of Infinity</font>; if you wish to avoid it, you will be expelled <font color="LEVEL">outside the Seed of Infinity</font>. However, the gaze isn't as painful as you feared. Has something happened to Ekimus?<br>
