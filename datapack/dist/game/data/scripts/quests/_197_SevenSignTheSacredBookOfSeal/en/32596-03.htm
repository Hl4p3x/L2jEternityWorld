<html><body>Library of Sages Director Sophia:<br>
I'm so sorry: document number 1667 was lost in the great fire. However, there is a copy...a 
handwritten, incomplete copy. It is a mysterious record in its own right--we have no record of its 
title, year of publication, author, or subject.<br>
I wonder if anyone has actually read it? Well I'm going to need to see some identification nefore I 
can turn this over. Do you have a library card?<br>
