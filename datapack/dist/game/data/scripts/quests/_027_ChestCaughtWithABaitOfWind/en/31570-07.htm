I think this is the <font color="LEVEL"> large blue treasure box</font>  that my client lost.
<br>
It seems to contain a blueprint of golem.
<br>
The only blacksmith in this whole area capable of making such a thing is Shaling in this village.
<br>
She told me recently that she had dropped a box containing a blueprint in the river while she was traveling.
<br>
This must be it!
<br>
Please take this blueprint of golem to Shaling in the Blacksmith Shop.</body></html>
