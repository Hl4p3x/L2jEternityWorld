You have not completed the Ceremony of Purification task. We cannot trust somedoby who does not perform the mission. If you are like this, we have no choice but to charge you a fee out of your reward.<br>
How about that? If you carry out the mission, you cannot get rewarded wholly, but do you still want to get a reward after the mission? Will you just receive your reward now with a little loss?<br>
