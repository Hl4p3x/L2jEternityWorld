Are you ready for a new mission?<br>
After swapping the Weapon Exchange Ticket you received previously with the Non-Grade Shadow Weapon, go visit <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">North Gate of Kamael Village</font> and return once you have defeated the monsters on the Golden Hill. To find <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela</font>, follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. I will tell you more later.<br>
Can I help you with anything else?<br>
