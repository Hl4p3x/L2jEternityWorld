<html><body>Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
Your arrogance is not the best choise to deal with the <font color="LEVEL">Land Dragon Antharas</font>. His power is beyond the measure.<br>
And your fate is all about meeting him face to face.<br>
Hs is *immoral*, when he dies, the proceess of reborn begins, so there's no possibility to wipe him out. Only killing him over and over again will stop his influence.<br>
But this will last until the new rebonrned Antharas will be back.<br>
