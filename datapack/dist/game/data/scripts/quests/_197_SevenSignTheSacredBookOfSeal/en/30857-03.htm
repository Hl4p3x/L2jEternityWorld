<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Well, the Emperor's Key is not a key at all, but a prayer. It dates back to the Elmoreden era, and 
is rather brief compared to other prayers of the time.<br>
I suspect here is a secret message hidden in that prayer, wich will reveal how it relates to the 
Sacred Book. I don't know anything more, but I think I know someone who can help.<br>
A friend of mine is a cryptologist -- a codebreaker. He might be able to determine the 
hidden meaning of the prayer. What do you think? Would you like to speak with him? <br>
