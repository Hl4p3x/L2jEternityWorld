Now, after all of you learned, it is necessary to find those who will help you! Warn them about danger which bear Embrio and Seven Seals. And also it is necessary to prevent for Embrio to catch force of the seals which have not appeared yet. You came here to hear my story, as well as the goddess very long time ago predicted... It is your destiny.<br>
More I can tell nothing to you. Hurry, you haven't enough time. Return to Eris, retell it our talk and... save the world from Embrio!<br>
