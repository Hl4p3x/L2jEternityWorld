Still trying to make sense of it all? Don't give up! Remember, I'm here to make things easier for you by giving you advice and assigning you missions suitable for your level.<br>Now go help <font color="LEVEL">Abyssal Celebrant Undrias</font> at the entrance to the <font color="LEVEL">Temple of Shilen</font>. To find him, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. When you have completed the task he gives you, come see me for your next mission.<br>
Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you?<br>
