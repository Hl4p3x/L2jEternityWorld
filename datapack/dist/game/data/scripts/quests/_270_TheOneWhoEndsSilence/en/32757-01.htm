<html><body>Priest Greymore:<br>

My friend is glad to see you again! Events develop with greater speed, than I thought earlier. You have very much helped me, having brought that letter. Monks have absolutely gone mad. Last night they have made the next awful ceremony in library which in their opinion will help to avoid a doomsday. Fools! It can do much harm only.<br>
<br>

Problem in that I don't know precisely, what ceremony they spent also the main thing, by means of any spells. To prevent pernicious consequences of this ceremony, I need to know precisely, they used what paternosters. Whether you want to help me?<br>
