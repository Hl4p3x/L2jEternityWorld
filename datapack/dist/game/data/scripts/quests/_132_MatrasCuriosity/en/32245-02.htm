In fact, I need a draft structure of the tower Steel Citadel. I know who has the necessary information to me, but I can not get it yourself. Perhaps ... Someone like you could enter the tower, find a project and bring it to me. Obviously, in <font color="LEVEL">Demon Prince</font> <font color="LEVEL">Ranku</font> in the Steel Citadel have access to a project that I need. Please bring me <font color="LEVEL">blueprint</font>, I love you very well rewarded.<br>
Oh! Another thing at last: take this raw ore. It may look rough, but rabotet same way as other ore. I think it will help you in this task.
