<html><body>Balu Kaimu:<br>
To meet my brother, Chuta Kaimu, start here and travel *southwest*. You will find him where the road ends.<br>
To wake him from his slumber, speak only the word *wagu*, the same word that my mother Shilen spoke when she gave him life. Possibly he will share his wisdom with you.
