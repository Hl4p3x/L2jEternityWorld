A while back someone was here asking about a <font color="LEVEL"> large blue treasure box</font>
<br>
The bait I gave you earlier was designed to find it!
<br>
Don't look so hurt!
<br>
It only works if the person using it doesn't know about it.
<br>
If you haven't found it yet, please continue to look for it.
<br>
Only you can use that bait now.
<br>
This should be easy for you!
<br>
I can't tell you who the <font color="LEVEL"> large blue treasure box</font> belongs to now, but I will if you find it!
<br>
It was lost near the shore.
<br>
Look for it there.
<br>
Your fishing skill must be level 9 and you must bring the box to me unopened.
<br>
Someone else may have found it by now, so make sure to ask around about it in the market.</body></html>
