<html><body>Newbie Guide:<br>
Welcome! Confused by how to begin your career as an adventurer?<br>
I and my fellow Newbie Guides can help you.<br>
In addition to giving you helpful tips, we will also assign you several missions to help you gain experience, acquire equipment and receive rewards.<br>
For your first mission, go help <font color="LEVEL">Zerstorer Marcela</font>. To find her, just follow the <font color="LEVEL">arrow</font> above your head. When you have completed the task she gives you, come see me for your next mission.<br>
Before you go, is there anything else I can do for you?<br>
