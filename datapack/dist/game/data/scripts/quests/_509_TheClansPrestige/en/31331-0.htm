Thank you! As a matter of fact, there are several Raid bosses around here. Which one can you defeat?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Ah! Of course you don't have to do so personally.</font> There is no rule that says a clan leader must take up the sword directly. <font color="LEVEL">You can order your clan members to defeat a Raid Boss, then bring me proof of the victory.</font><br>
