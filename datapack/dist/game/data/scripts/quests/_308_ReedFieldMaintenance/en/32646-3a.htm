Why haven't you left yet? As I said before, seek out <font color="LEVEL">Mucrokian Fanatic, Mucrokian Ascetic, Mucrokian Savior, Mucrokian Preacher and Contaminated Mucrokian</font>. Tear off the hide of each one you kill and bring them back to me. You can find these ghastly beasts between the Fields of silence and the field of Whispers.<br>
Now hurry!
