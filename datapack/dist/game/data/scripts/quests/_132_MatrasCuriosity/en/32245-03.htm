In fact, I need a draft structure of the tower Steel Citadel. I know who has the necessary information to me, but I can not get it yourself. Perhaps ... Someone like you could enter the tower, find a project and bring it to me. Obviously, in <font color="LEVEL">Demon Prince</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Ranku</font> in the Steel Citadel have access to a project that I need.<br>
Please bring me <font color="LEVEL">blueprint</font>, I love you very well rewarded.
