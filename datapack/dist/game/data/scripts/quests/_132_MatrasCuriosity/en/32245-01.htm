You know that I am very interested in the magnificent structure, called the Steel Citadel (Steel Citadel). I researched it, but it is strange that I did not find completed projects. It seems that it was constructed independently by many different parties... I'm still looking for additional information, but without success.<br>
You would be willing to help me?<br>
