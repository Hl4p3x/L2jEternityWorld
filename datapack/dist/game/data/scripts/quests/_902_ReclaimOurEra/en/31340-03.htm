Alright, there are three high priority targets.<br>
In Goddard, the Varka Silenos and Ketra Orcs Leaders have been rallying their troops. We need someone to go in there and eliminate the cause of their hostility.<br>
In the swamps near Rune, there is the Cannibalistic Stakato Chief... apparently it's got a taste for it's own kind. Creates a chemically induced state that causes it to go on a rampage. We need it taken out.<br>
Lastly, there is Anais in the Monastery of Silence. Our Intel is sketchy on the exact nature of this threat only that they need to be eliminated.<br>
