Nice to meet you! I - Orion, devoted serving to Floran Gardener. My boss - one of the greatest agricultural geniuses in all Aden. After such successful Leta Fordson has repeatedly invested the capital in new party of the improved magic seeds. He has decided to grow up them during the Autumn season. Fortunately, all of us still have seeds.<br>
You wouldn't like to help me?<br>
You can receive nectar, killing any monsters of your level all over the world.<br>
Inoculate a seed, having clicked on nectar two times! Grow up it and receive the prizes! Good luck!<br>
Pumpkins grow from nectar. If you amaze a pumpkin with the weapon it will break!<br>
You understand, what I have told to you?<br>
