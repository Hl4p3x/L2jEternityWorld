Yes, very long ago anybody here wasn't. You want to learn in more detail about our action?<br>
At us now, passes action <font color="LEVEL">L2Day</font>. To take part and receive prizes, you need to kill monsters to beat out LETTERS and to collect from them one or the other words:<br>
<font color="FF0066">N C S O F T</font><br1>
<font color="FF0066">L I N E A G E II</font><br>
Can beat everybody, but remember that for percent of drop-out of a thing plays a role level of your player and level of the killed monster. So test good luck!<br>
