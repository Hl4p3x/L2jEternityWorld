You have not done all that I asked of you. Remember that you have to have killed seven dragons at least once each. If you haven't killed at least one <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, Black Dagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, and Muscle Bomber</font> each, then you're not done.<br>
